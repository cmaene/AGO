## ArcGIS Online related resouces

Scripts I wrote to utilize AGO resources via it's API

#### "users"
Scripts for our organizational user management:

(1) flag inactive org users using LDAP, like those who already graduated.

(2) delete inactive users - move items to temp locations, "past_users" before deleting the users 

#### Note for scrape_geocodeago.sh
(1) Web scraping - 
Get past 30-days prostitution arrest records from the Chicago Police Department (ASP), and scrape the table contents & save mugshot photos.

(2) Geocoding -
Geocode both home address and arrested location using ESRI ArcGIS geocoding API.

(3) Routing -
Calculate travel time in minutes and distance in miles using ESRI ArcGIS routing API.

The output is a | (pipe) delimited text file with the processed date in the file name, i.e. outputMMDDYY.txt.  

This script should be run every 30 days. At this point, I am running on the 1st day of the month at 3am even though I would miss 31 day..
