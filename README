(1) Web scraping - 
Get past 30-days prostitution arrest records from the Chicago Police Department (ASP), and scrape the table contents & save mugshot photos.

(2) Geocoding -
Geocode both home address and arrested location using ESRI ArcGIS geocoding API.

(3) Routing -
Calculate travel time in minutes and distance in miles using ESRI ArcGIS routing API.

The output is a | (pipe) delimited text file with the processed date in the file name, i.e. outputMMDDYY.txt.  

This script should be run every 30 days. At this point, I am running on the 1st day of the month at 3am even though I would miss 31 day..
